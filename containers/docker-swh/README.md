# SWH dev environment
```text
SWH provides a way to duplicate and store scanned software, but unfortunately 
this function in swh is not the main feature, Until now this function is still 
in internal testing status which is a potential risk for pelc2.

We should focus on bulk importing many archives to verify its stability, from 
my testing it seems some swh service will be dead or out of memory.

FYI we should not use a self-maintained SWH instance, we need to search for 
other ways to use SWH or drop this tool. Anyway need to come a conclusion ASAP
```


## SWH Instance info:
```text

SWH public project repo: 
https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-environment.git

Note: 
currently SWH use dev mode to deploy, the official provides a production way. 
From my point of view, it use puppet tool to deploy which is our not good at:
https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/puppet-environment/ 
https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/puppet-swh-site/
```
